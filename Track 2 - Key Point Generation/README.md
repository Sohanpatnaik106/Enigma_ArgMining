- The Key_Points.csv file that was generated in notebook 2, was then downloaded and then the key_point_id were given manually, in continuation with the sequence of the test dataset key_points.csv. For example, if key_points for topic 1 ends on serial number kp_0_8, then the generated key_points's key_point id for topic 1 starts from the id kp_0_9 and so on for the rest of the two topics (out of the three topics for which we had to generate key_points)
